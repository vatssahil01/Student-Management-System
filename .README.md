# 🎓 MERN Project Management System (Backend)

A Role-Based Project Management System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication.

This system allows Students to submit project proposals, Admins to approve and assign Teachers, and Teachers to track and update project progress.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT (Authentication)
- bcrypt (Password Hashing)
- ES Modules (import/export)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The backend follows a modular, scalable architecture.




---

# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

## 1️⃣ User Roles

The system supports three roles:

- `student`
- `teacher`
- `admin`

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures each role can access only permitted resources.

---

## 2️⃣ Authentication Flow

### Registration
- User provides name, email, password, role
- Password is hashed using bcrypt
- User is saved in database

### Login
- Email & password verified
- JWT token generated
- Token contains:
  - user ID
  - user role

### Protected Routes
- Token sent via:

- Middleware verifies token
- Decoded user attached to `req.user`

---

# 🧠 Core Concepts Explained

## 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT works like a digital identity card.

After login:
- Server creates token
- Client sends token with every request
- Server verifies token
- Access is granted if valid

---

## 🛡️ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Instead of checking manually, routes use:

```js
authorizeRoles("admin")

// Mental Model of the System
User logs in
      ↓
Receives JWT Token
      ↓
Token identifies user & role
      ↓
Middleware validates identity
      ↓
Role determines access
      ↓
Database performs controlled operations
